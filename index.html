               Our minds blur at the edges <br>
            your thoughts, my thoughts, 
                a single pulse.

              Time, a living thread, <br>
              moving slowly through the strings, 
               the universe hums.

              A distant sun rises, 
        black trees casting shadows on us, 
        while we are drifting through the golden beams.

                It's almost like I hear you saying,
                "So, what do you want?"
                "I want you," I said in my mind,
                but to you, I said, "Nothing."

                And so you left, <br>
                thinking that this is what I meant to say.

                "Give it time," you said, </p>
                 As if time was gentle,
                 As if it did not carve through me </p>
                 like wind through withering branches.
